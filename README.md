✅ Prepares the app for deployment on Render

**Objective:**

A user-friendly diary where:

📅 Entries are displayed by date, sorted newest to oldest

🖼 Each entry appears as a card, showing a preview image and title

👁 Clicking a card opens a modal with full entry details

➕ Users can add new entries via a modal form, with input validation

💾 All entries are saved to localStorage for persistent access

React (with functional components + hooks)

TailwindCSS

Web Storage API (localStorage)

✅ Building and managing a clean React component tree

🎯 Using React state and side effects to control data and modals

🧠 Working with localStorage to persist entries between sessions

🎨 Styling UI with TailwindCSS for a responsive, modern look

📦 Organizing code for scalability and readability

Search/filter entries by keyword or date

Add tags or categories

Markdown support for entry content

Light/Dark mode toggle

**Instructions:**

- Create a piece of state that represents the state of the bulb.
- Pass the value of that state to the Lightbulb component, based on its value, render the className "container" or "container night" in its outermost div
- Track how many times the bulb has been turned on on a separate piece of state.
- Change the button label to reflect the current state ("Turn on", "Turn off", or "Locked").
- Prevent the bulb from turning on after it has been activated 10 times, and show an alert instead.
- Add a reset button to clear the counter and allow the bulb to be used again.
